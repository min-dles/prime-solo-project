      <p>Everyone has chores, but it can be hard to get into a flow about
        when things need to get done:</p><ul>

        <li>Washing the windows?</li>
        <li>Cleaning the toaster? </li>
        <li>Sweeping the garage?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A reminder on your phone can feel stressful or even boring.</p>
      <p><b>But what if you could look to the moon instead for guidance on when
        these things need to get done?</b> </p>

      <p>Chore Cycle is an opportunity to sync your chore list with the moon
        phases so you are more connected to the rhythms of nature. Itâ€™s a
        gentle reminder that these simple tasks are essential parts of our lives,
        and that getting into cycles can be incredibly helpful and empowering
        when forming positive habits.</p>
