# Prime Solo Project: Chore Cycle 

Chore Cycle is an opportunity to sync your chore list with the moon phases so you are more connected to the rhythms of nature. Itâ€™s a gentle reminder that these simple tasks are essential parts of our lives, and that getting into cycles can be incredibly helpful and empowering when forming positive habits.

## NOTE ABOUT THIS BRANCH: 
This version of the code base includes Astronomy API details, for future use and further integration. It will be removed from the branch that is deployed June 2023 but available for future release. 

## STRETCH GOAL(S)
1. Higher Priority Items: 
  - About (Typewriter animation text for "About" blurb)
  - Frame around className="content-view"
  - Edit / Delete buttons changed to Icons/Emojis 
  - Clean up LoggedIn view layout (borders, typography, spacing)
  - Switch around Login VS Register New User on Home page 
  (LandingPage) 
  - refactor the <ul> elements so that KEY is on <li>
2. DELETE: confirmation pop-up
3. Change Favicon on tab to a moon emoji
4. Add transition animations between views
5. Custom scrollbar?
6. Per user experience collected on 6/7/23, consider changing the flow/hierarchy of Nav in upper-right vs. the moon phase views. 
7. Using the lunarphase.js dependency, combine the functionality of moon shadow percentage with the divs and CSS shading on the moon clock (percentage corresponds with the actual current shading reported from lunarphase.js)
