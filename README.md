# Prime Solo Project: Chore Cycle 

Chore Cycle is an application you can use to sync your chore list with the moon phases so you are more connected to the rhythms of nature. Itâ€™s a gentle reminder that these simple tasks are essential parts of our lives, and that getting into cycles can be incredibly helpful and empowering when forming positive habits. Chore Cycle will help you organize your chores, and teach you the cycles of the moon.
